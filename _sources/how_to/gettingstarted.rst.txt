Getting Started

Hi! welcome to the beginning of your journey. Before you start to learn how to use the 
TrendPy package you must install it on your desktop enviornment. Unfortunately **TrendPy is not 
avialable via pip yet**.

So you must **install the package manually on your desktop.** Don't worry. We will lead you to
through this process step by step:

Manually installation on native python
========================================

Please follow the steps below if you have native python installed on your desktop:

#. First you must :download:`download the package <../trendPy-main.zip>` 
#. Extract the downloaded .zip file in a folder you can find again.
#. Open the extracted trendpy-main folder. You should see a folder with the same name there.
#. Open this folder as well.
#. You should now see a folder called TrendPy
#. Copy this folder by clicking on it and pressing ``ctrl + c`` on your keyboard then.
#. Navigate to your python directory. Depending on your pythons version the path should look like this by default installation ``C:\Users\name\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39``
#. Open the ``Lib`` folder
#. Search and open the ``site-packages`` folder then.
#. Paste the copied TrendPy folder into the ``site-packages`` folder by pressing ``ctrl + v`` on your keyboard.


Manually installation on the Anaconda distribution
=========================================================

Please follow the steps below if you use python via the Anaconda distribution:

#. First you must :download:`download the package <../trendPy-main.zip>` 
#. Extract the downloaded .zip file in a folder you can find again.
#. Open the extracted trendpy-main folder. You should see a folder with the same name there.
#. Open this folder as well.
#. You should now see a folder called TrendPy
#. Copy this folder by clicking on it and pressing ``ctrl + c`` on your keyboard then.
#. Navigate to your Anaconda3 directory. The path should look like this by default installation ``C:\Users\name\anaconda3\``
#. Open the ``Lib`` folder
#. Search and open the ``site-packages`` folder then.
#. Paste the copied TrendPy folder into the ``site-packages`` folder by pressing ``ctrl + v`` on your keyboard.

Cool! You have installed the package on your desktop now.
To verify this you can open or create a python script and import the package with ``import TrendPy``. If no error appears 
the package was installed successfully and you can go ahead by reading the documentation.
